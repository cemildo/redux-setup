# Myworkspace

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) using [Nrwl Nx](https://nrwl.io/nx).

Nx is an open source toolkit for enterprise Angular applications.

Nx is designed to help you create and build enterprise grade Angular applications. It provides an opinionated approach to application project structure and patterns.

## Quick Start & Documentation

[Watch a 5-minute video on how to get started with Nx.](http://nrwl.io/nx)

## Generate your first application

Run `ng generate app myapp` to generate an application. When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same CLI workspace. Read more [here](http://nrwl.io/nx).

## Development server

Run `ng serve --project=myapp` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project=myapp` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build --project=myapp` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

# redux-setup

## Redux help
Component triggers 
`
constructor(public appFacede: AppFacade) {
    this.appFacede.loadAll();
}
`
which will register selectors for store changes and at the same time trigger an action to load the data.
It will first hit an action(defined in dispatch function) and there action type will be set then since the action type is known it is going to hit reducer. Reducer tries to get information from store if store does not have the information then related effects will be called from store (it knows realted effect because of the action type) and it will try to get data form services. After data is return in effects it will return another action which will be captured by actions then thru reducer store will be updated. Since selectors are ready from the begining and listining to changes from store, they will be updated and the data will be given to component.
